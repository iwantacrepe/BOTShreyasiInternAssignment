# Python Development Intern Assignment

This repository contains solutions for the Python Development Intern assignment at BOT Shreyasith.

## Files

- **`weather_aggregation.py`**: Contains a function to aggregate weather data for each city.
- **`prime_factorization.py`**: Contains a function to perform prime factorization of an integer.
- **`sql_query.sql`**: Contains an SQL query to update product prices in a database.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Basic SQL database setup (e.g., MySQL).

## How to Use

### 1. Weather Aggregation

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the `weather_aggregation.py` script using the following command:

    ```bash
    python weather_aggregation.py
    ```

3. The script will output the average temperature and humidity for each city based on the sample data.

### 2. Prime Factorization

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the `prime_factorization.py` script using the following command:

    ```bash
    python prime_factorization.py
    ```

3. The script will output the prime factors and their exponents for the given integer (default example: 60).

### 3. SQL Query for Data Manipulation

1. Use any SQL database system of your choice (e.g., MySQL).
2. Load the `products` table with the columns: `id`, `name`, and `price`.
3. Execute the SQL commands provided in the `sql_query.sql` file:

    - The first query updates product prices by 10%.
    - The second query displays the updated prices along with product names.

## Notes

- Ensure Python scripts and SQL commands are executed in compatible environments.
- If you encounter any issues or need extra time to complete the assignment, please reach out.
